### Brief Intro

Hey,

It is Zhaoyi Luo, a native Shanghainese, born in China.

I achieved my master degree from Cornell University in December 2020, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering, under the supervision of Professor [A. Kevin Tang](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/kevin-tang).

Currently, I am working as a software engineer at Microsoft in High Performance Computing (HPC), mainly on providing customers to run large-scale applications efficiently in the cloud. One of products our team is contributing is [Azure Batch](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/batch/).

This site is my personal place and will be updated periodically. The major topics cover C++, Python, machine learning, and any troubles I have encountered during my daily work.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Zhaoyi :)
