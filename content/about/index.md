### Brief Intro

Hey,

I'm Zhaoyi Luo, a native of Shanghai, China.

I earned my Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University in December 2020, where I studied under the guidance of Professor [A. Kevin Tang](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/kevin-tang).

Currently, I work as a software engineer at Microsoft in the High Performance Computing (HPC) team. I focus on enabling customers to run large-scale applications efficiently in the cloud. One of the products our team contributes to is [Azure Batch](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/batch/).

This site is my personal space and will be updated periodically. I cover topics such as C++, Python, machine learning, and challenges I encounter in my daily work.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Zhaoyi :)
