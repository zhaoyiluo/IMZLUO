### Brief Intro :wave:

Hey there,

It is Zhaoyi Luo, a native Shanghainese, born in China.

I achieved my master degree from Cornell University in December 2020 majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering under the supervision of Professor [A. Kevin Tang](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/kevin-tang).

Currently, I am working as a research engineer at Tencent in deep learning, mainly on machine learning inference. Our team open-sourced [Forward Project](https://github.com/Tencent/Forward) in March 2021, a library for high-performance deep learning inference on NVIDIA GPUs, and now I am one of the contributors continuing to maintain and enhance the project.

This site is my personal place will be updated periodically. The main topics cover C++, Python, machine learning, and any troubles I have encountered during my daily work.

Free feel to contact me and please let me know if you have any other questions.

Zhaoyi :)
