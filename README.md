Hello everyone, it is Zhaoyi Luo.

I achieved my master degree from Cornell University in December 2020 majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering under the supervision of Professor [A. Kevin Tang](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/kevin-tang).

Currently, I am working as a research engineer at Tencent in deep learning, mainly on machine learning inference. Our team open-sourced [Forward Project](https://github.com/Tencent/Forward) in March 2021, a library for high-performance deep learning inference on NVIDIA GPUs, and now I am one of the contributors continuing to maintain and enhance the project.

This repo is used for my personal website [IMZLUO](https://www.imzluo.com/) and will be updated periodically. The main topics cover C++, Python, machine learning, and any troubles I have encountered during my daily work.

The site is built with the Hugo theme [DoIt](https://github.com/HEIGE-PCloud/DoIt) and I really appreciate all the help [@HEIGE-PCloud](https://github.com/HEIGE-PCloud) provides during my painful work. TBH, I do not even know `Node.js` is one of the back-end platforms at the first time I played with Hugo, not to mention `rpm-build`. If you are also interested in this theme, please do not hesitate to show your gratitude to her team. It could not be better than [a cup of coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/PCloud).

BTW, please let me know if you have any other questions.

Zhaoyi :)
